# CalcUS - Quantum Chemistry Web Platform
CalcUS brings all the necessary tools to perform quantum chemistry in a user-friendly web interface. It strives for simplicity, clarity and efficiency.

This project is developed by the Legault group at the Université de Sherbrooke (Sherbrooke, Canada).

Documentation and an overview of the platform are available on [ReadTheDocs](https://calcus.readthedocs.io/).

## Updating from Version 1.2.1
Due to major changes in the underlying code, **it is not possible to migrate the database to CalcUS version 2**. A new Docker repository has been created from the images of version 2 and thus you must update your local code (either with `git pull` or by redownloading this repository) in order to start using CalcUS version 2. Otherwise, you will keep using version 1.2.1, which will not be updated further.

## CalcUS Cloud
We are developing a cloud service to give you access to CalcUS without any configuration. This service, [CalcUS Cloud](https://calcus.cloud), will be aimed mostly at professors which want to teach practical quantum chemistry. Entire classes will be able to follow an online curriculum and run real, lightning-fast xTB calculations. This service is currently in the alpha stage. If you would like to have early access to the platform, email us at `contact@calcus.cloud`.

## Installation

For licensing reasons, **no software package requiring a user license can be included with CalcUS.** For convenience, we have included the LGPL-v3 licensed [xtb software package](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb) as well as related packages by the Grimme group ([crest](https://github.com/grimme-lab/crest), [stda](https://github.com/grimme-lab/stda) and [xtb4stda](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb4stda)). These enable fast semi-empirical tight-binding calculations in CalcUS by default. 

CalcUS also contains a redistribution of the open-source wavefunction analysis program [Multiwfn](http://sobereva.com/multiwfn/) along with its license. If you use molecular orbitals from CalcUS, please also cite Multiwfn: Tian Lu, Feiwu Chen, "Multiwfn: A Multifunctional Wavefunction Analyzer", *J. Comput. Chem.*, **2012**, *33*, 580-592. DOI: [10.1002/jcc.22885](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.22885)

In order to use other software packages, you will need either to install the Linux version of a package locally or use the packages on remote clusters. 

### Linux and Mac
Firstly, install and configure [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). On Linux, it is necessary to create a docker group and to add yourself to it:

<pre>
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
</pre>

Then, clone the repository. In that repository, a file named `.env` will be needed to set the necessary environment variables. The script `generate_env.py` can be used to interactively create that file. Simply run it with the command `python3 generate_env.py` and answer the questions.

### Windows
You will need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You might also need to install WSL2 when prompted by Docker. Note that Windows 7 (and older versions of Windows) are not supported.

Further configuration of WSL2 is recommended, as it acquires a large amount of RAM by default (much more than necessary). To do so, go to your user profile home (accessible by entering `%USERPROFILE%` in the file explorer) and create a file called `.wslconfig`. This file has the following format:

<pre>
[wsl2]
memory=2GB
processors=2
</pre>

You can of course tweak the parameters to your liking. It will be necessary to restart the Docker service to apply the change.

Then, clone the repository. In that repository, a file named `.env` will be needed to set the necessary environment variables. The script `generate_env.py` can be used to interactively create that file. For convenience, you can simply execute `generate_env.bat` to call this script. You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to execute the script (any version of Python 3 will work). Simply answer the questions to create the environment file.

## Running CalcUS
Once the setup is complete, launch CalcUS using `start.sh` (Linux, Mac) or by executing `start.bat` (Windows). CalcUS is now available in your web browser at the address `localhost:8080`. On Mac, you might need to manually start the docker service if you've just installed it. It will start automatically at boot in the future.

The first startup might take several minutes, as the different services used within CalcUS are being downloaded. The database must also be created and configured. Subsequent startups will be considerably faster. A superuser account will be created with the username specified in the `.env` file. You can use this account as main account, but make sure to change the password if the server is accessible to others.

Also note that the `.env` *contains sensitive information* and should only be accessible by the server administrator.

By default, the startup script will automatically update CalcUS from stable Docker images and remove unused images. If you use Docker other than for CalcUS or do not want this behaviour, you might want to modify the startup script. Moreover, if you would prefer building the Docker image instead of downloading it (500-600 MB), you can build the image and run CalcUS in development mode using `start_dev.sh` on Mac/Linux or `start_dev.bat` on Windows.
